            <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
            <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>

                    <h3>Numbers</h3>
                    <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping.</p>
                    <code>>>>(50 - 5*6) / 4</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>5.0</code>
                </li>
                <li class="sec-section">
                    <h3>String</h3>
                    <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result</p>
                    <code>>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes</code><br>
                    <code>'spam eggs'</code>
                </li>
                <li class="sec-section">
                    <h3>Lists</h3>
                    <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>
                    <code>>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</code><br>
                    <code>>>> squares</code><br>
                    <code>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</code>

                <li class="sec-section">
                    <h3>if Statements</h3>
                    <p>The if statement is used for conditional execution:</p>
                    <code>if_stmt ::=  "if" expression ":" suite</code> <br>
                    <code>("elif" expression ":" suite)*</code><br>
                    <code>["else" ":" suite]</code>
                    <p>It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one by one until one is found to be true (see section Boolean operations for the definition of true and false); then that suite is executed (and no other part of the if statement is executed or evaluated). If all expressions are false, the suite of the else clause, if present, is executed.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="sec-section">
                    <h3>while Statements</h3>
                    <p>The while statement is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true:</p>
                    <code>while_stmt ::=  "while" expression ":" suite</code><br>
                    <code>["else" ":" suite]</code>
                    <p>This repeatedly tests the expression and, if it is true, executes the first suite; if the expression is false (which may be the first time it is tested) the suite of the else clause, if present, is executed and the loop terminates.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="sec-section">
                    <h3>for Statements</h3>
                    <p>The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:</p>
                    <code>for_stmt ::=  "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite</code><br>
                    <code>["else" ":" suite]</code>
                    <p>The expression list is evaluated once; it should yield an iterable object. An iterator is created for the result of the expression_list. The suite is then executed once for each item provided by the iterator, in the order returned by the iterator. Each item in turn is assigned to the target list using the standard rules for assignments (see Assignment statements), and then the suite is executed. When the items are exhausted (which is immediately when the sequence is empty or an iterator raises a StopIteration exception), the suite in the else clause, if present, is executed, and the loop terminates.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
            <header>Modules</header>
            <p>If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.</p>
            <p>To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).</p>
            <p>A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Classes">
            <header>Classes</header>
            <p>Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.</p>
            <p>Compared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.</p>
